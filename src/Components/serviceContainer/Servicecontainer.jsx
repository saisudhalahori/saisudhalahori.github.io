<p className='service_para'>With reference to our discussion in your office on 6.02.2024 ,we are pleased to offer our consulting services for
carbon footprint mapping , science based targets for net zero emissions , nature based solutions and other
activities for meeting these targets , ESR reporting and Climate Change Mitigation Advisory for various units of
the Vardhman Group. This would cover all aspects of energy consumption patterns and usage , water consumption
and efficiency of various processes including waste treatment , opportunities of recycling & energy recovery and
any other area which may require intervention from carbon footprint perspective .</p>

<p className='service_para'>We also offer our services for facilitation of carbon credits for your existing and new Solar PV based power plants.
This would involve survey, analysis and the necessary documentation (project concept note ,baseline study report
and the PDD) , submission of these to the appropriate platform for processing and follow-up for ensuring all
process compliance for final issuance of verified carbon credits. Besides this, your existing plantations which have
proper records of time of plantation and species, are also eligible for carbon credits and we offer our services for
facilitation of carbon credits for them as well. All these verified carbon credits that can be accrued to you would be
vital for meeting your net zero carbon emission targets and a better ESG rating..
